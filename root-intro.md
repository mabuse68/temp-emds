The EMDS
========
The common [European mobility data space (EMDS)](deployemds.eu) aims to facilitate data access, pooling and sharing for more efficient, safe, sustainable and resilient transport.

The deployEMDS project’s primary objective is to deploy an operational data space and common governance mechanisms to facilitate trusted and secure data sharing in the context of urban mobility.

The project supports real-life implementations in nine cities and regions: 
* Barcelona (ES)
* Île-de-France (FR)
* Milan (IT)
* Lisbon (PT)
* Flanders (BE)
* Sofia (BG)
* Stockholm (SE)
* Tampere (FI)
* Budapest (HU).

These initiatives focus on the development of innovative services and applications in urban mobility, while assisting in policymaking through the sharing and reuse of data.
